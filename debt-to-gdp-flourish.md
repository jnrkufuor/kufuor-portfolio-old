This is a visualization of the general government debt data from 1995 to 2019. It was downloaded from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development website. It captures data from a range of countries that most likely belong to the OECD. 
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance.
