# "What's your Genotype?", should be a first date question!


### Outline
#### Setup
Blindly entering a partnership could lead to giving birth to a child with an SS genotype

#### Conflict
SDC's mortality rate, though reduced over the years, is quite high if not managed. The medical bills that accompany management it are fairly high making it a diffuclt diseases to manouever through

#### Resolution

### Data
1. [Centre for Disease Control and prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/data.html)
   This data would be primarily used to shed light on the distribution of sickle cell disease(SDC) patients and non-SDC patients. 
2. [SDC Race Distribution Data](https://jnrkufuor.github.io/kufuor-portfolio/race_distribution_michigan_1997-2014.csv)
   This would be used to explain how sickle cell is distributed amongst different races to understand if there is a prevalence in any of the races.
3. [SDC Medical Costs Data](https://jnrkufuor.github.io/kufuor-portfolio/medical_costs_SDC_US.csv)
   This would be used to draw a side by side bar graph of the medical expenses of SDC patients.
4. [SDC US Death Trend Data](https://jnrkufuor.github.io/kufuor-portfolio/death_trend_US_SDC.csv)
   This would be used to create a line graph to understand the mortality rate of SDC patients over the years.
