# "What's your Genotype?", should be a first date question!


### Outline
#### Setup
Blindly entering a partnership could lead to giving birth to a child with an SS genotype

#### Conflict
SDC's mortality rate, though reduced over the years, is quite high if not managed. The medical bills that accompany management it are fairly high making it a diffuclt diseases to manouever through

#### Resolution
Knowing each others Genotype before getting into a serious relationship can prevent severe loss down the line. 



### Initial Sketches

### Data
1. [Centre for Disease Control and prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/data.html)
   This data would be primarily used to shed light on the distribution of sickle cell disease(SDC) patients and non-SDC patients. 
   Supplementary Data: http://www.scdcoalition.org/pdfs/ASH_Infographic.pdf
2. [SDC Race Distribution Data](https://jnrkufuor.github.io/kufuor-portfolio/race_distribution_michigan_1997-2014.csv)
   This would be used to explain how sickle cell is distributed amongst different races to understand if there is a prevalence in any of the races.
3. [SDC Medical Costs Data](https://jnrkufuor.github.io/kufuor-portfolio/medical_costs_SDC_US.csv)
   This would be used to draw a side by side bar graph of the medical expenses of SDC patients.
4. [SDC US Death Trend Data](https://jnrkufuor.github.io/kufuor-portfolio/death_trend_US_SDC.csv)
   This would be used to create a line graph to understand the mortality rate of SDC patients over the years.
 
   
### Medium
The project would go three three major stages
#### Brainstorming and Prototyping
The initial phases of the project would constitute paper sketches,testing, exploration and brainstorming. The goal here is to ideate on the best ways to present the data and then run it by users to check whether my representation is clear enough. Paper sketches would suffice in this phase.
#### Building the Graphs
Once robust solutions have been desined, the next phase is to build my graphs with the data at hand. I would use Tableau to build the graphs.
#### Presentation
This would be completed in Shorthand. My objective is to tell a story with my data and Shorthand offers a good functionality to achieve this.
